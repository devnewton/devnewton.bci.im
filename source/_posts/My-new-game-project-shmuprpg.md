I'm starting a new opensource game project: [shmuprpg](https://git.bci.im/shmuprpg/).

It mix *shoot them up* and *action rpg* gameplay.

Like all my games, it is playable [online](http://play.bci.im), but this time
it is a native web game. I wrote it to practice some technologies:
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
[brunch](http://brunch.io) and Phaser (http://phaser.io).
