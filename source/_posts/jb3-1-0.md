I have released [jb3 1.0](https://git.bci.im/jb3), a webapp designed to include every feature needed by a
modern mouling solution:

- bouchot with XML, TSV and Websocket/JSON backends.
- b2b with out the box alive tribune support: Batavie, Dlfp, Euromussels and Sveetch.
- responsive coincoin with a cool paster: file upload, multiline text, audio record, image drawing, emoji and totoz search.
- multi user webcam visio conference.
- norloge timezone translation.
- fortunes and archives search engine.
- trollmeter radar.
- sara, a nice bot assistant that can tell you jokes, forecasts, cultural and political facts.
